# A Rails-ready box for EG-259

## Creation steps

This is what I did to get this ready. I followed the instructions provided by Ryan Bates in his excellent RailsCast episode [#292 Virtual Machines with Vagrant](http://railscasts.com/episodes/292-virtual-machines-with-vagrant?view=asciicast)  (See also the [accompanying screencast](http://railscasts.com/episodes/292-virtual-machines-with-vagrant)).

    $ vagrant box add lucid32 http://files.vagrantup.com/precise32.box
    
    $ vagrant init precise32 http://files.vagrantup.com/
